# w11-aero-project
Formula 1 rear aerodynamic system inspired by the Mercedes W11. Full CAD model, DRS mechanism, and diffuser airflow surfaces

A detailed CAD project replicating and evolving the rear aerodynamics of the Mercedes W11 Formula 1 car, including:

- Rear wing with functional DRS flap
- Central actuator housing
- Endplates and vortex management
- Rear crash structure and diffuser
